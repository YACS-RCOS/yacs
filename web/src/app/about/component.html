  <h1>About YACS</h1>
  <p>
    YACS is an open-source course scheduler for the community at Rensselaer
    Polytechnic Institute. It's one of the leading projects of the
    <a href="http://rcos.io">Rensselaer Center for Open Source</a>
    and is supported by Red Hat. It's got a
    <a href="http://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs">repository on Github</a>
    and a <a href="http://yacsblog.wordpress.com">blog on Wordpress</a>. If you
    have a bug report or feature request, send us an email at

  <h2 class="bottomrule">History</h2>
  <p>
    In the fall of 2010, the Rensselaer Open Course Scheduler was becoming
    increasingly antiquated. Jeff Hui, RPI class of 2012, decided to create
    yacs.me, an improved and much more user-friendly site, as an RCOS project.
  </p>
  <p>
    YACS quickly became a staple of RPI. Then, as years went by and the original
    development team graduated, it gradually fell into disrepair. Requests
    slowed and the accuracy of data became less reliable.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the fall 2015 semester, a new group was formed to repair and restore the
    site and bring it back up for the upcoming semesters. The API was refactored
    into Ruby on Rails, and it and the Web frontend were rebuilt from the ground
    up. It garnered support from Red Hat in January 2016, became established
    on-campus in early March, and finally launched to the RPI community on March
    21.
  </p>
  <h2 class="bottomrule">Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Thus far, the YACS team has focused on re-implementing all of the major
    features from the older version, while trying to maximize its flexibility so
    that it can be used at other institutions. So far, it's more or less at
    feature parity with the old YACS already, and there are several other
    features that didn't exist in that version.
  </p>
  <p>
    We currently still consider YACS to be in beta. Once YACS has been deployed
    at another school and we implement support for multiple semesters, we'll
    probably mark it as the first 1.0 release.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our current projects include adding multiple semesters of data, providing a
    control panel for administrative use, refactoring the Web frontend, and
    improving our search engine. Keep an eye on our blog and our Github issue
    tracker to stay updated.
